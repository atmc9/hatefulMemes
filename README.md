Most of the parameters are already adjusted. No need to change a lot of them. "embeddings": 300,
    "language_feature_dim": 300,
    "vision_feature_dim": 300,
    "fusion_output_size": 256,
    "output_path": "model-outputs",
    "dev_limit": None,
    
    These parameters are not being used in the code so no tweaking is required. Rest of the parameters can be tweaked.
